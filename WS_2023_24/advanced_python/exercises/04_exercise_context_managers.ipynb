The specific date of the epoch and the handling of leap seconds is platform dependent. On Windows and most Unix systems, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) and leap seconds are not counted towards the time in seconds since the epoch. This is commonly referred to as Unix time. To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at gmtime(0)."],"metadata":{"id":"e4Eg8gMHCUKL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from time import time, sleep\n","\n","\n","class Timer(object):\n","    pass"],"metadata":{"id":"YVayTBGnDDiM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with Timer():\n","    sleep(2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"P3cDRvB0DY3S","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666626137614,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1573,"user":{"displayName":"Tomas Kontrimas","userId":"13639993128393726277"}},"outputId":"ad01dce2-5292-4178-8122-cda9f439addd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Time elapsed: 2.00s\n"]}]}]}
